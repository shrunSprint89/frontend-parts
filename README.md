# Frontend-parts

Project is still _WIP_.

An attempt to comparatively analyse frontend technologies and frameworks. A compilation that can help a frontend engineer be more language and framework-agnostic.

Built with ❤️ using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Nuxt content](https://content.nuxt.com/) and [Vue-3](https://vuejs.org/), with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) powering the UI components.
