Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of **solutions provided by React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte** for each of the challenges identified:

### 1. **User Interface Reusability**

**Challenge**: Building modular, reusable UI components to reduce duplication.

- **React**: Functional/class components with JSX for composability.
- **Angular**: TypeScript-based components with `@Component` decorators and template encapsulation.
- **Vue**: Single-file components (`.vue` files) combining HTML/CSS/JS.
- **Svelte**: Compile-time components with reactive syntax (`$:`).
