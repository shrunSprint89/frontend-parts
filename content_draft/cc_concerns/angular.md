### Cross-Cutting Concerns in Angular

**Challenge**: Handling universal issues like accessibility, testing, and security.

Angular provides built-in solutions for cross-cutting concerns:

**Accessibility**:

- Built-in ARIA roles
- Accessibility checkers
- Semantic HTML support

**Testing**:

- Karma/Jasmine integration
- Component testing utilities
- E2E testing with Protractor

**Security**:

- Built-in DOM sanitizer
- XSS protection
- CSRF prevention

**Best Practices**:

1. Follow WCAG guidelines
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Use security best practices
4. Regular accessibility audits
