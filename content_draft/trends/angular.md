# Future Trends 2025 for Angular

## Compiler-Driven Optimizations
- Enhanced AOT compilation
- Improved tree-shaking
- Smarter change detection
- Reduced bundle sizes

## Island Architecture
- Partial hydration support
- Component-level hydration
- Selective interactivity
- Improved initial load times

## Unified Tooling
### Vite Integration
- Faster development server
- Improved HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Better build performance
- Native ESM support

## Emerging Features
1. **Signal-based Reactivity**
   ```typescript
   import { signal } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     template: `
       <div>Count: {{ count() }}</div>
       <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
     `
   })
   export class CounterComponent {
     count = signal(0);
     increment = () => this.count.update(n => n + 1);
   }
   ```

2. **Zero-Runtime Components**
   - Compile-time optimizations
   - Reduced runtime overhead
   - Better performance metrics

3. **Enhanced Developer Tools**
   - Improved debugging capabilities
   - Better performance profiling
   - Advanced state management tools

## Performance Improvements
- Smaller runtime footprint
- Faster initial load times
- Improved memory management
- Better mobile performance

## Development Experience
- Simplified configuration
- Better error messages
- Enhanced type checking
- Improved IDE support
