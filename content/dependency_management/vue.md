### Dependency Management in Vue

**Challenge**: Avoiding bloat from third-party libraries.

Vue provides efficient dependency management through:

- Opt-in libraries (e.g., VueUse)
- Composables
- Key features include:
  - Plugin system
  - Composition API
  - Package ecosystem
  - Tree-shaking support

**Best Practices**:
1. Use composables for reusable logic
2. Evaluate plugins carefully
3. Implement proper tree-shaking
4. Regular dependency audits
5. Optimize bundle size
6. Use modern build tools
