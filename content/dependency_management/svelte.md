### Dependency Management in Svelte

**Challenge**: Avoiding bloat from third-party libraries.

Svelte emphasizes minimal dependencies through:

- Minimal dependencies by design
- Built-in functionality
- Key features include:
  - Built-in state management
  - Minimal runtime dependencies
  - Efficient bundling
  - Package optimization

**Best Practices**:
1. Use built-in features when possible
2. Evaluate external dependencies carefully
3. Regular dependency audits
4. Monitor bundle size impact
5. Implement proper code splitting
6. Optimize package imports
