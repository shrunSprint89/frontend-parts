### Dependency Management in React

**Challenge**: Avoiding bloat from third-party libraries.

React emphasizes lightweight dependency management through:

- Lightweight hooks (e.g., useSWR)
- Minimal core dependencies
- Key features include:
  - Custom hooks
  - Component composition
  - NPM ecosystem
  - Package optimization

**Best Practices**:
1. Create custom hooks
2. Evaluate dependencies carefully
3. Use modern package managers
4. Regular dependency updates
5. Monitor bundle impact
6. Implement proper code splitting
