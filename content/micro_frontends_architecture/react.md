### Micro Frontends Architecture in React

**Challenge**: Scaling apps across independent teams.

React supports micro frontends through:

- Module Federation (via Webpack)
- Key features include:
  - Runtime integration
  - Shared dependencies
  - Independent deployments
  - Team autonomy

**Best Practices**:
1. Implement proper module federation
2. Manage shared state
3. Handle cross-app communication
4. Coordinate team workflows
