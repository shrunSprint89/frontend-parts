### Integration with APIs in Svelte

**Challenge**: Fetching and managing external data.

Svelte provides streamlined API integration through:

- onMount lifecycle function
- Stores for state management
- Key features include:
  - Reactive statements
  - Promise handling
  - Automatic subscription management
  - Built-in async support

**Best Practices**:
1. Use stores for API state
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Handle loading states
4. Manage API dependencies
5. Create reusable fetch logic
6. Follow Svelte's reactive patterns
