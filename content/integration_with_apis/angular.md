### Integration with APIs in Angular

**Challenge**: Fetching and managing external data.

Angular provides robust API integration through:

- HttpClient module
- RxJS integration
- Key features include:
  - Observable-based requests
  - Interceptors for request/response handling
  - Type-safe HTTP operations
  - Request cancellation

**Best Practices**:
1. Use HttpClient for API calls
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Utilize interceptors effectively
4. Follow RxJS best practices
5. Handle request cancellation
6. Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
