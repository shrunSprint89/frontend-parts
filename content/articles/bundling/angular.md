# Bundle Size Management in Angular

**Challenge**: Reducing JS payloads for faster load times.

Angular provides powerful bundle optimization through:

- Ivy compiler for tree-shaking
- Key features include:
  - Ahead-of-Time compilation
  - Dynamic imports
  - Module lazy loading
  - Differential loading

**Best Practices**:

1. Use lazy loading for routes
2. Implement proper code splitting
3. Optimize third-party imports
4. Enable production mode
5. Use build optimizer
6. Regular bundle analysis
