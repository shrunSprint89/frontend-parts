### 2. **State Management**

**Challenge**\: Managing shared state across components.

- **React**: Context API, Redux, or Zustand for global state.
- **Angular**: RxJS-powered services and `@ngrx/store` for reactive state.
- **Vue**: `ref()`, `reactive()`, and Pinia/Vuex for reactivity.
- **Svelte**: Built-in stores (`writable`, `readable`) with automatic reactivity.
