### Performance Optimization in Angular

**Challenge**: Reducing render cycles and improving responsiveness.

Angular provides powerful performance optimization features through:

- Zone.js optimizations
- OnPush change detection strategy for improved performance
- Key features include:
  - Automatic change detection optimization
  - Efficient rendering cycles
  - Smart dependency tracking

**Best Practices**:
1. Use OnPush change detection where possible
2. Implement trackBy function for ngFor directives
3. Lazy load modules
4. Optimize change detection cycles
