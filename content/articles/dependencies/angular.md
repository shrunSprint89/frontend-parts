### Dependency Management in Angular

**Challenge**: Avoiding bloat from third-party libraries.

Angular provides comprehensive dependency management through:

- Built-in HTTP client
- RxJS integration
- Key features include:
  - Dependency injection system
  - Built-in services
  - Module system
  - Package management

**Best Practices**:

1. Use built-in solutions when possible
2. Implement proper tree-shaking
3. Regular dependency audits
4. Version management
5. Optimize RxJS imports
6. Use peer dependencies correctly
