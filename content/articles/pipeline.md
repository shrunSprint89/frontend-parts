## Introduction

Th world of frontend engineering is understood much better imho by understanding the various problem domains that fall under it. This article lists potential problem domains that can be analyzed here in the near future as part of a comparative study in frontend engineering.

## Problem Domains that can be compared next

### 1. **UI Component and code Reusability**

- **Focus**: How different frameworks facilitate the creation and management of reusable UI components.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Component lifecycle, props management, and state handling.
- [x] **Published**

### 2. **State Management**

- **Focus**: Approaches to managing application state across different frameworks.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Built-in state management solutions (e.g., React's Context API vs. Angular's Services vs. Vuex in Vue).

## 3. **State Management solutions in the ecosystem**

- **Focus**: Approaches to managing application state across different frameworks' ecosystems
- **Comparative Aspects**: External state management solutions (e.g., Redux vs. NgRx vs. Pinia).

### 4. **Performance Optimization**

- **Focus**: Techniques used to enhance application performance.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Rendering strategies, lazy loading, and code splitting.

### 5. **Accessibility (a11y)**

- **Focus**: Ensuring applications are usable by people with disabilities.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Built-in accessibility features, guidelines adherence, and testing tools.

### 6. **Routing**

- **Focus**: How different frameworks handle client-side routing.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Dynamic routing capabilities, nested routes, and route guards.

### 7. **Testing Frameworks and Strategies**

- **Focus**: Approaches to testing frontend applications.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing tools.

### 8. **Styling Approaches**

- **Focus**: Methods for styling components within applications.
- **Comparative Aspects**: CSS-in-JS (React), Angular's ViewEncapsulation, and scoped styles in Vue.

### 9. **Internationalization (i18n)**

- **Focus**: Strategies for supporting multiple languages and locales.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Built-in support for localization.

### 10. **Internationalization using external libraries**

- **Focus**: Strategies for supporting multiple languages and locales.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Third-party libraries that can be used for localization.

### 9. **Development Workflow and Tooling**

- **Focus**: Tools and practices that streamline the development process.
- **Comparative Aspects**: CLI tools, build systems (Webpack vs. Angular CLI vs. Vue CLI), and package management.

### 10. **Community and Ecosystem**

- **Focus**: Community support around each framework.
- **Comparative Aspects**: Available libraries, plugins, and community resources, documentation coverage and readability
