# Headless Architecture in Angular

Component libraries with DI services form the backbone of Angular's headless architecture approach.

## Key Features

- Dependency Injection (DI) services for business logic separation
- Component libraries that focus on functionality over presentation
- Reusable services that can be injected across different UI components

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create abstract services for business logic
2. Implement UI-agnostic components
3. Use DI to connect services with presentation layer

## Benefits

- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Flexible UI implementation
- Reusable business logic

## Best Practices

- Keep services stateless when possible
- Use interfaces to define service contracts
- Implement facade patterns for complex logic
- Leverage Angular's DI system effectively
