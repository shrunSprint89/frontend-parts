### Performance Optimization in React

**Challenge**: Reducing render cycles and improving responsiveness.

React offers several performance optimization techniques:

- Virtual DOM diffing
- Memoization tools:
  - React.memo for functional components
  - useMemo for value memoization
  - useCallback for function memoization
  
**Best Practices**:
1. Use proper key props
2. Implement code splitting
3. Avoid unnecessary re-renders
4. Optimize state updates
