### Performance Optimization in Svelte

**Challenge**: Reducing render cycles and improving responsiveness.

Svelte takes a unique approach to performance:

- Compiles to vanilla JavaScript
- Eliminates runtime overhead
- Key features include:
  - No virtual DOM needed
  - True reactive declarations
  - Minimal runtime code

**Best Practices**:
1. Use reactive statements efficiently
2. Leverage Svelte's built-in transitions
3. Implement proper state management
4. Use proper event handling
