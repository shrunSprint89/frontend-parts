### Bundle Size Management in Vue

**Challenge**: Reducing JS payloads for faster load times.

Vue provides efficient bundle optimization through:

- Vite's Rollup-based optimizations
- Key features include:
  - Tree-shaking
  - Dynamic imports
  - Async components
  - Module federation

**Best Practices**:
1. Use async components
2. Implement route-level code splitting
3. Optimize dependency imports
4. Configure chunking strategy
5. Regular bundle analysis
6. Use production optimizations
