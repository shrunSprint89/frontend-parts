### Bundle Size Management in React

**Challenge**: Reducing JS payloads for faster load times.

React offers effective bundle optimization through:

- Code splitting with React.lazy()
- Key features include:
  - Dynamic imports
  - Route-based splitting
  - Component lazy loading
  - Suspense integration

**Best Practices**:
1. Implement code splitting
2. Use dynamic imports
3. Optimize import statements
4. Monitor bundle size
5. Tree shake unused code
6. Use production builds
