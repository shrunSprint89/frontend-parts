### Bundle Size Management in Svelte

**Challenge**: Reducing JS payloads for faster load times.

Svelte excels at bundle optimization through:

- Zero runtime, compile-time optimizations
- Key features include:
  - Compile-time framework stripping
  - Component-level code splitting
  - Tree-shaking by default
  - Minimal runtime code

**Best Practices**:
1. Use dynamic imports
2. Implement proper code splitting
3. Leverage SvelteKit optimizations
4. Monitor bundle sizes
5. Optimize third-party imports
6. Regular performance audits
