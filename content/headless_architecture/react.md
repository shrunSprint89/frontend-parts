# Headless Architecture in React

Headless libraries like TanStack Table provide UI-agnostic functionality in React applications.

## Key Features
- UI-agnostic state management
- Separation of business logic from presentation
- Flexible rendering patterns
- Framework-agnostic core functionality

## Popular Headless Libraries
- TanStack Table (formerly React Table)
- Downshift
- React Hook Form
- Headless UI

## Implementation Strategy
1. Use hooks for logic encapsulation
2. Implement render props pattern
3. Create custom hooks for reusable logic
4. Separate state management from UI

## Benefits
- Maximum flexibility in UI implementation
- Improved reusability
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced maintainability

## Best Practices
- Keep business logic in custom hooks
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement controlled components when needed
- Document API contracts clearly
