# Headless Architecture in Vue

Composables provide a powerful way to implement headless architecture in Vue applications.

## Key Features
- Composables for logic reuse
- UI-agnostic state management
- Flexible component composition
- Reactive data handling

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create composables for business logic
2. Implement UI-agnostic state management
3. Use composition API for better organization
4. Separate concerns effectively

## Benefits
- Improved code reusability
- Better maintenance
- Flexible UI implementation
- Clear separation of concerns

## Best Practices
- Keep composables focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Document composable interfaces
- Follow Vue's composition API guidelines

## Examples
```vue
// Using composables for business logic
const useDataFetching = () => {
  // Logic implementation
  return {
    // Exposed methods and state
  }
}
```
