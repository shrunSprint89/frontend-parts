## Perspective

### The Frontend Engineering Dilemma:

#### State of the software engineering market

Job postings often fixate on specific framework experience (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) and Portfolios are expected to showcase expertise in particular frameworks. Hiring processes tend to over-emphasize framework-specific knowledge

#### The Reality

Frontend frameworks have relatively short lifecycles [(Brutal lifecyle of JS frameworks)](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/https:/). Popular frameworks today might be legacy technology in 3-5 years. The JavaScript ecosystem is particularly volatile in terms of framework popularity

#### Observation

Employers and recruiters often overlook more valuable, foundational skills such as:

- Core JavaScript proficiency
- Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, Browser APIs)
- Performance optimization principles
- Accessibility knowledge
- State management concepts
- Component architecture
- Testing methodologies

### Better Approach and what this website hopes to help with

Instead of framework-specific requirements, I opiniate that the below are a better group to work on:

- Problem-solving abilities
- Understanding of frontend fundamentals
- Ability to learn and adapt to new technologies by comparative learning of problems and solutions
- Experience with architectural patterns and best practices
- Knowledge of web standards and browser behavior

The key point is that strong foundational knowledge and problem-solving skills are more valuable long-term than expertise in any single framework, as these skills transfer across all frontend technologies and probably help the learner visualize other engineering aspects with a bird's eye view contributing to quick assimilation and better understanding of any new framework the developer may need to grasp.
