## The Frontend Engineering Dilemma:

**State of the software engineering world**, atleast as of 2025, is that a lot of focus is usually put on the complete and in-depth and even syntactic knowledge of a particular framework in the induxtry and while that maybe a good thing to quickly hit the ground running within an existing project, it could also mean that you could be missing out on the bigger picture of frontend engineering, and on being able to adapt to new technologies and frameworks, and to quickly solve problems with better solutions whenever they arise. This is especially true in the frontend engineering space, where the technology landscape is constantly evolving.

#### The Reality

Frontend frameworks have relatively short lifecycles [(Brutal lifecyle of JS frameworks)](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/). Popular frameworks today might be legacy technology in 3-5 years. The JavaScript ecosystem is particularly volatile in terms of framework popularity

#### Observation and opinion

Foundational skills such as the ones below are more valuable long-term than expertise in any single framework, as these skills transfer across all frontend technologies and probably help the learner visualize other engineering aspects with a bird's eye view contributing to quick assimilation and better understanding of any new framework the developer may need to grasp.

- Programming fundamentals and clean code practices
- Component architecture
- State management concepts
- Testing methodologies
- Performance optimization principles
- Accessibility knowledge
- Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS concepts, Browser APIs)
- Core JavaScript proficiency

#### Better Approach and what this website hopes to help with

Instead of framework-specific learning as a path, I am of the opinion that the below are a better group to work on before looking to be an expert in any specific framework:

- Problem-solving abilities
- Understanding of frontend engineering domain fundamentals (which might also include general software engineering concepts like design patterns, architecture, etc.)
- Ability to learn and adapt to new technologies by comparative learning of problems and solutions
- Knowledge of web standards and browser behavior

The key point is that strong foundational knowledge is more valuable long-term than expertise in any single framework and using this website, I hope to share my learnings and experiences with the community.

Hope this comparative learning approach helps you in your journey to becoming a better frontend engineer.

## What this website is not

This website is not a replacement for the official documentation of any framework. It is a supplementary resource to help you understand the concepts and make a comparative analysis of the frameworks. I also don't attempt to be exhaustive in my coverage of the frameworks. I will be adding more content as I learn and understand more about the frameworks. I also hope to keep this website up to date with the latest developments in the frontend ecosystem.

## How to use this website

This website is a work in progress. I will be adding more content every week. The content is organized in a way that you can follow along with the topics and learn at your own pace. Each topic in the left sidebar is will be a frontend engineering problem domain (and may have sub-domains within) and if you open the topic, you will see a list of articles that will be a comparative analysis of popular frameworks and their respective solutions to that problem domain.
