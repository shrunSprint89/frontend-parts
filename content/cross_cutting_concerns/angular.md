**Challenge**: Handling universal issues like accessibility, testing, and security.

Angular provides built-in solutions for cross-cutting concerns:

**Accessibility**:

- Component testing utilities
- E2E testing with Protractor

**Security**:
- Built-in DOM sanitizer
- XSS protection
- CSRF prevention

**Best Practices**:
1. Follow WCAG guidelines
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Use security best practices
4. Regular accessibility audits
