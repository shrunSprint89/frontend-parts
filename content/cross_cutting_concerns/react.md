### Cross-Cutting Concerns in React

**Challenge**: Handling universal issues like accessibility, testing, and security.

React provides tools and patterns for cross-cutting concerns:

**Accessibility**:
- ESLint plugins for a11y
- React-axe for testing
- ARIA support

**Testing**:
- Jest + Testing Library
- Component testing
- Integration testing

**Security**:
- JSX sanitization
- XSS prevention
- Security best practices

**Best Practices**:
1. Use accessibility tools
2. Implement comprehensive tests
3. Follow security guidelines
4. Regular security audits
